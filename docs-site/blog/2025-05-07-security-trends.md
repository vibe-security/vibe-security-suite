Welcome to the Vibe Security Suite blog! In 2025, the security landscape is evolving faster than ever. Here are the top trends shaping the year:

## 1. Open Source Security Goes Mainstream
Open source security tools are now the backbone of modern development. Projects like Vibe Security Suite empower teams to adopt best practices without vendor lock-in.

## 2. Developer-First Security
Security is shifting leftâ€”developers are running scans locally and in CI/CD, catching issues before code even reaches production.

## 3. AI-Powered Threat Detection
AI and machine learning are now essential for identifying threats at scale. From code analysis to anomaly detection, AI is everywhere.

Stay tuned for more insights, tutorials, and updates from the Vibe Security community!
